        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This pickle grilled cheese is filled with havarti and chopped dill pickles and pan-toasted to golden perfection. I highly recommend serving this with dill pickle kettle chips for the maximum pickle experience!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 slices sourdough bread</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded havarti cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped dill pickles</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons softened butter, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place bread on a work surface and spread mayo evenly on one side of each bread slice.</li>
            <li>Toss cheese and pickles together in a bowl until evenly combined. divide cheese mixture evenly among 4 bread slices. Place remaining 4 bread slices, mayo side down, on top of cheese and pickle mixture.</li>
            <li>Spread the tops of sandwiches evenly with half of softened butter. Heat a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Place sandwiches, buttered side down, in skillet. Spread remaining butter evenly over tops of sandwiches. Cook until golden brown and toasted on bottom side, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until cheese is melted through and bread is toasted on both sides, about 4 minutes more. Serve immediately.</li>
